# GIT SEARCH USER

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project allows user to search for github user via username. Once you type a letter to the searchbar, it will show a list of username that can be found on Github. Click on the username to show more information about the user. If no suggestion is shown, it means there's no username that matches the search. Debounce is implemented to the searchbar to reduce the api call to the backend. To get started follow the getting started guide.
